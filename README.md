## About Me

Hello, software engineers, my name is Adrienne Burney, I am someone that has always been an ambitious individual, always ready to learn new skills to add to my resume. I have two degrees: â€” Associate of Applied Science: Entertainment and Technology â€”Bachelor of Arts: Graphic Design Visual of Arts; and I have a certificate for front-end web developer from an online boot camp called Skillcrush. Everything that I have learned over these past few years has given me the basics skills needed for the software engineering world.
Well wishes to all and keep moving forward!! :)
